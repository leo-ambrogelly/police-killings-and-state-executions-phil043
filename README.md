This project combines and graphs data from the Espy File (ICPSR 8451), the Death Penalty Information Center, the Fatal Encounters dataset, and the Mapping Police Violence dataset in order to graph executions and estimated police killings in the United States since 2000. 

It is acknowledged that owing to the crowdsourced nature of the later two datasets, it may be the case that increased public awareness of police violence at the turn of the millenium may have lead to higher reporting rates for police killings in crowdsourced datasets. Nonetheless, the objective of this preliminary analysis was to demonstrate the growing prevalence of police killings vs. prison executions.
